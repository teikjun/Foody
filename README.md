# Foody
An extensible and customizable food delivery web application, written in React and Node!

## Who is this for?  
Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, there has been an increase in demand for food delivery services.
Foody is built for people who want to start their own food delivery service.

Foody is a food delivery application which you can customize and extend according to your fancy. 
Foody provides a simple interface for customers, riders (who deliver the food), restaurant staff, and manager.  
If you are planning to cook and deliver the food by yourself, then you are the rider, restaurant staff and manager at the same time.

## Features
### Customers
Customers can view a list of available food items and their reviews, and place their orders accordingly. 
After receiving their order, they can also write reviews for the order.
